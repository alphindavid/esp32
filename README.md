#About ESP32
The ESP32 is a low-cost, powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, developed by Espressif Systems. It features a dual-core processor with a clock speed of up to 240 MHz, making it suitable for a wide range of IoT and embedded applications. The ESP32 supports various communication interfaces like UART, SPI, and I2C, along with multiple GPIO pins, ADC, and DAC. It can be programmed using platforms like the Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF, and MicroPython. Its versatility, high processing power, and robust connectivity make it popular for smart devices and automation systems.

#Getting started with Arduino IDE
•	Download Arduino IDE 
•	After installling the application 
o	In your Arduino ide go to file  Preferences Additional board manager urls(paste this url)

URL = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

Note: If u already have some urls there, then u can paste this url after separated by a comma( , ).

o	Open the Boards Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
search for esp32 and install the esp32 by Espressif Systems
•	Now go to tools  boards  select your boardin my case it’s the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1) and select the port 
•	You can start with example code from File examples.

Now you are all set…..

#Troubleshooting
•	If your board is not recognized by the PC, then go to device manager ports
If it is not there then u need to download usb to uart driver for your esp32.
Go to https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads and download CP210x Windows Drivers  and install it.

•	If you try to upload a new sketch to your ESP32 and you get this error message “A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out… Connecting…“. It means that your ESP32 is not in flashing/uploading mode.
Hold-down the “BOOT” button in your ESP32 board
Press the “Upload” button in the Arduino IDE to upload your sketch:
 After you see the  “Connecting….” message in your Arduino IDE, release the finger from the         “BOOT” button
